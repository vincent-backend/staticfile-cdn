    subtitle: "1. Background and objectives",
    description: "<p>CDNs such as Google Ajax Library, Microsoft ASP.net CDN, SAE, Baidu, Upyun, etc. all provide free JS library storage, but their use is somewhat limited because they only provide some JS libraries. Of course, we can also have a platform like CDNJS, which stores most of the mainstream JS libraries, even CSS, image and swf, but the domestic access speed is not very ideal, and there is a lack of many excellent domestic open source libraries. </p><p>Therefore, we provide such a warehouse to include as many excellent open source libraries as possible, and provide CDN acceleration services for free to provide better access speed and stable environment. At the same time, we also provide access to open source libraries so that everyone can submit open source libraries, including static files such as JS, CSS, images, and swf. </p>"

    subtitle: "2. Update the open source library",
    description: "<p>Theoretically we automatically update the version file of the library and will not delete the old version, but if you are in <a href='https://www.staticfile.net' target='_blank'>www.staticfile.net</a> If the latest version cannot be found, you can add a version directory to the library, modify the corresponding package.json file, and use Pull Request to remind us. </p><p>Therefore, we provide such a warehouse to include as many excellent open source libraries as possible, and provide it with CDN acceleration services for free, so that it can have better access speed and a stable environment. At the same time, we also provide access to open source libraries so that everyone can submit open source libraries, including static files such as JS, CSS, images, and swf. </p>"

    description: "<p>Although most libraries are open source based on the MIT/BSD License, some libraries are different in personal/commercial applications, such as the Highcharts library, so please be careful when using these libraries. Fortunately, you can click on its website and code repository (links in the search results) to view its open source agreement. </p>"
