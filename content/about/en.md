  subtitle: "1. Background and objectives"
  description: "CDNs such as Google Ajax Library, Microsoft ASP.net CDN, SAE, Baidu, Upyun, etc. all provide free JS cart storage, but their use is somewhat limited because they only provide some JS carts. Of course, we can also have a platform like CDNJS, which stores most of the mainstream JS vehicles, even CSS, images and swf, but the domestic access speed is not ideal, and there is a lack of many domestic excellent open source vehicles.
  Therefore, we provide such a warehouse truck to collect as many excellent open source trucks as possible, and provide it with CDN acceleration services for free, so that it can have better access speed and stable environment. At the same time, we also provide an entrance to open source car sources, so that everyone can submit open source cars, including static files such as JS, CSS, image, and swf."

  description: "象Google Ajax Library, Microsoft ASP.net CDN, SAE, Baidu, Upyun等CDN上都上都免费提供的JS车的上我问自动更新车的版本文件，并且不会跑车删除旧版本, 但如果你在static file.org找不到最新的版本, 则可以通过往该中添加一个版本目录，并且修改相应的package.json文件，利用Pull Request来提醒我们。&nbsp;
  因此，我们提供这样一个仓车，让它尽可能全面收录优秀的开源车，并免费为之提供CDN加速服务，使之有更好的访问速度和稳定的环境。<a href='https://aaa/dsf'> asdfds</a> 同时，我们也提供开源车源接入的入口，让所有人都可以提交开源车，包括JS、CSS、image和swf等静态文件。"
