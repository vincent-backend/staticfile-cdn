  Therefore, we provide such a warehouse truck to collect as many excellent open source trucks as possible, and provide it with CDN acceleration services for free, so that it can have better access speed and stable environment. At the same time, we also provide an entrance to open source library sources, so that everyone can submit open source libraries, including static files such as JS, CSS, image, and swf.</p>"
